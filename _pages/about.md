I am currently a Ph.D. student at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/) in the Department of Mechanical Engineering under the supervision of Prof. [Guillaume Durandau](https://www.mcgill.ca/mecheng/guillaume-durandau) and Prof. [Jozsef Kovecses](https://www.mcgill.ca/mecheng/jozsef-kovecses). I am also a member of [MyoSuite](https://sites.google.com/view/myosuite) since Sep 2023.

Previously, I obtained a M.Sc in Physics at Trottier Space Institute [(TSI)](https://tsi.mcgill.ca/) with Prof. [Nicolas Cowan](https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~cowan/) and Prof. [Eve J. Lee](https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~evelee/). I completed a B.S with College Honors and Departmental Highest Honors at the University of California at Los Angeles [(UCLA)](https://www.ucla.edu/) with Prof. [Smadar Naoz](https://www.astro.ucla.edu/~snaoz/).

My primary area lies in neuromusculoskeletal simulations. Specifically, I am focusing on using reinforcement learning (RL) to recreate nature human gaits such as walking and balance by controlling muscle activations. Our research stands on the intersection of healthcare, machine learning and mechanical actuating.
